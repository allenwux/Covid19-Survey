## Dealing with Coronavirus: A daily questionnaire
This questionnaire was designed to locate potential geographic areas in which the coronavirus is spreading in Israel. You will be asked about potential symptoms of the virus. A better estimation of the number of infected people in each area will help to identify locations in which the number of infected people is particularly high. 

Please fill out the questionnaire every day and separately for each family member. It is important to fill out the questionnaire also in cases where you and your family are feeling well and do not experience any symptoms.  

Note that this questionnaire cannot diagnose coronavirus infection. It is anonymous and all the data will be used solely for tracking the spread of the virus. We are taking every measure to keep the privacy of participants. 

We thank you for your participation,

Prof Eran Segal, Weizmann Institute of Science
Prof Yuval Dor, The Hebrew University of Jerusalem
